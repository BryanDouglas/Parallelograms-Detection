Cause it's the first time to process image in OSX/iOS, I used to code in Windows so it's a little bit tricky for me at first.
Making this introduction to make others who do detection in Mac easier to get involved.

I  Build Enviornment
1. Add libraries like UIkit, CoreGraphic.
2.


II  A lot diffs, This is Xcode 9.0 vision
1. create images
NSString* imageName = [[NSBundle mainBundle]
                    pathForResource:@"image1" ofType:@"JPG"];
NSImage* tempImage = [[NSImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:imageName];

2.show images
In ViewController.h
add 'IBoutlet NSImageView *xx'
In View........m
in Dialog, add 'xx=[NSImage Imagenamed:@""];
